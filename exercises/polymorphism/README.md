# Polymorphism Exercise
This exercise is meant for you to code using polymorphism. You will use the `Cat` and `Dog` classes to create a driver that call upon the sounds each animal makes without caring which animal is called.

Provided is `Cat`, `Dog`, `Animal`. It is your job to write code that can be used in polymorphism. In the driver, I expect a method named `animalSays` that simply prints out what the animal says. 

## Grading
This is a non-graded exercise.
