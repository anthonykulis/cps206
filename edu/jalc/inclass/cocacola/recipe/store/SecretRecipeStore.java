/*

		This is a store of secret recipes.

		There can only be one instance of the store!
		The store houses a collection of recipes that require a pin number to access.
		This pin number belongs to an employee, so only that employee, using their pin, can access the recipe!
		Make sure your `getRecipe` method checks for the employee's pin against the recipes pin! If the pins do not
		match, throw an exception.
