# Test Two Study Guide
This covers the topics of the test and tips on how to prepare for it. This test is 9 questions and has 3 bonus questions, for a total of 12 questions. The test covers everything after ending the advanced class topics up to the start of 
interfaces. Like all tests, there are no make-ups. You will be graded on the best 3 out of 4, so if you miss a test for any reason, it will be your dropped exam.

# Topics
These are the topics of the test, note they are not the questions to the test. This means the topics are not mutually
 exclusive and you will be graded on them across multiple portions of the test.

* The core pillars of OOP
	* This is from CPS176, but it is paramount to this class
* Understanding introduced keywords 
	* Examples: `final`, `abstract`, etc
	* When to use them
	* What they mean
	* How they affect your code
* Inheritance 
	* Extending classes
	* Forcing implementation of methods
	* Using parent methods
	* Overriding methods
* Polymorphism
	* Identifying when polymorphism should be used
	* Understanding the effects of polymorphism
* Advanced Topics
	* Open/Closed Principle

### Bonus Topics
You will get 10 points bonus to the exam. This means the best possible score is 110/100. Bonus topics do not receive partial credit. There are 3 questions. Each question is all or nothing.

	
## Tips to success
This test is very much like the previous test. I expect you to demonstrate application of theory. No question you 
will see on this test can be memorized from in class examples or class notes. Exactly like the previous test, the 
only way to succeed is to write lots of code. 


There is no reason you cannot redo the course work we have done in class for different topics. Create a repository, write code, finish the topic. Create another repository, write code, finish the topic. The more code you write, the higher the likelihood you will encounter the problem I ask you to solve. Encountering the problem I ask you to solve and solving it successfully under non-graded status will lead you to solving it correctly under graded status. It is as simple as 
that.

Some questions are partial credit, others are not. If you do not know the answer, it behoves you to attempt. I do not indicate where partial credit is to be applied.
