# Test Three Study Guide
This test covers the topics everything from interface introduction to the builder pattern. Like all tests, there are no make-ups. You will be graded on the best 3 out of 4, so if you miss a test for any reason, it will be your dropped exam. The test will be out of 100 points with the possibility to earn 10 extra credit points. There are an 11 questions, 2 of which is are major coding problem worth 24 points each. There are also 6 short answer questions and 3 minor coding problems. The minor coding problems are extensions to your major coding problems and will be graded for correctness *against* those problems. This means if you have an issue in your major coding problem, but you use it correctly as written in your minor coding problem, you will not be deducted points as long as the minor coding problems meets the requirements for full marks.

# Topics
* Pillars to OOP
* Polymorphism into Interfaces
* Interface Segregation Principle
* Builder Pattern
* Interface Injection
* Interface implementation
* Anonymous Interfaces
* Lambdas 

### Bonus Topics
* The 5 SOLID Principles

## Tips to success
* Write code. Write code. Write code.
* I do not ask any questions that will allow you to memorize code and repeat it verbatim. You must understand how to apply code for given problems.
* You will be writing classes, interfaces, and lambdas.
* You will be instantiating those said classes.
* Do not miss the first problem. It has been the first problem on every test so far and will be on this one.
* Because this is about interfaces, I will not be grading the body of methods but rather the signatures, visibility, etc.
* If you are still confused on what polymorphism is, and since you will be required to use it on this exam fairly heavily, I high suggest you practice it and ask any questions you need before the exam.
* This exam spends more time on testing your understanding of interfaces than anything else. Do not get caught up with the builder pattern. You have just spent 2+ weeks demonstrating to me you know how to write a builder pattern. Spend 95% of your time understanding interfaces, polymorphism, etc.
