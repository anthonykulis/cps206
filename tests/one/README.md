# Test One Study Guide
This covers the topics of the test and tips on how to prepare for it. This test is 8 questions and has 3 bonus questions, for a total of 11 questions. The test covers everything after ending the review up to the start of abstraction. Like
 all tests, there are no make-ups. You will be graded on the best 3 out of 4, so if you miss a test for any reason, 
 it will be your dropped exam.

# Topics
These are the topics of the test, note they are not the questions to the test. This means the topics are not mutually
 exclusive and you will be graded on them across multiple portions of the test.

* The core pillars of OOP
	* This is from CPS176, but it is paramount to this class
* Understanding introduced keywords 
	* Examples: `class`, `enum`, `static`, `private`, etc
	* When to use them
	* What they mean
	* How they affect your code
* POJO 
	* Constructing them
	* Accessors/Mutators
		* When should they be used
	* Composite objects
* Unit tests
	* Why write them
	* How to write them
	* How to write them *effectively*
* Advanced Topics
	* Single Use Purpose / Single Responsibility Principle
	* DRY Principle
	* Singleton Pattern

### Bonus Topics
You will get 10 points bonus to the exam. This means the best possible score is 110/100. Bonus topics do not receive partial credit. There are 3 questions. Each question is all or nothing.

* Understanding what code is doing by its standardized syntax style
* Testing code you did not write
* Applying learned principles to contribute to Java core libraries
	
	
## Tips to success
This is *not anything like* the tests you took in CPS176. Do not think studying the way you did for those will help you in any sense on this test. This test, like all to come, are application of theory. The *only* way you will pass this test is if you understand how to apply the theory in a time-limited environment. Since you have not seen any of these questions presented in class, only their topics discussed and demonstrated, you will find this completely foreign if you have not written lots and lots of code. 

Steps to preparing to pass the exam:

1. Write code
2. Write code
3. Write code

There is no reason you cannot redo the course work we have done in class for different topics. Create a repository, write code, finish the topic. Create another repository, write code, finish the topic. The more code you write, the higher the likelihood you will encounter the problem I ask you to solve. Encountering the problem I ask you to solve and solving it successfully under non-graded status will lead you to solving it correctly under graded status. It is as simple as 
that.

Some questions are partial credit, others are not. If you do not know the answer, it behoves you to attempt. I do not indicate where partial credit is to be applied.
